# Product Context: C++ Demo Application

## Purpose
The C++ Demo Application serves as a reference implementation for modern C++ development practices. It addresses the common challenges developers face when setting up C++ projects, particularly around environment consistency, dependency management, and containerization.

## Problems Solved

### 1. Development Environment Inconsistency
- **Problem**: C++ development environments often vary between developers, leading to "works on my machine" issues.
- **Solution**: Provides a standardized development environment using Distrobox, ensuring all developers work with identical toolchains and dependencies.

### 2. Complex Dependency Management
- **Problem**: Managing C++ dependencies can be challenging and error-prone.
- **Solution**: Integrates Conan package manager to handle dependencies in a consistent, reproducible way.

### 3. Build System Complexity
- **Problem**: C++ build systems can be complex and difficult to configure correctly.
- **Solution**: Implements a clean, modern CMake configuration that follows best practices.

### 4. Containerization Challenges
- **Problem**: Containerizing C++ applications often results in bloated images with unnecessary dependencies.
- **Solution**: Provides scripts to analyze dependencies and create minimal Docker containers with only required libraries.

### 5. Development-to-Production Consistency
- **Problem**: Ensuring consistency between development and production environments.
- **Solution**: The containerization approach ensures that the production environment closely mirrors the development environment.

## How It Works

### User Experience
1. Developers clone the repository and use the provided scripts to set up their development environment.
2. The build system automatically handles dependencies and configuration.
3. Developers can build and test the application locally.
4. When ready for deployment, the containerization scripts create optimized Docker images.

### Key Workflows

#### Development Workflow
1. Set up development environment using Distrobox
2. Edit code in VSCode with full IDE support
3. Build using the `build.sh` script
4. Test the application locally

#### Containerization Workflow
1. Configure container parameters in `.dist_build` and `.env_dist`
2. Run `build.dist.sh` to create a minimal Docker container
3. Deploy the container to the target environment

## User Experience Goals
- Provide a frictionless setup experience for new developers
- Ensure consistent behavior across different environments
- Minimize the learning curve for modern C++ development practices
- Enable easy containerization for deployment
- Support a smooth development workflow with modern tooling

## Future Directions
- Expand the demo to showcase more C++ features and libraries
- Add CI/CD pipeline examples
- Include more advanced containerization techniques
- Demonstrate integration with common C++ frameworks
