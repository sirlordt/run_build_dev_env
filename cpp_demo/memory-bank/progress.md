## What Works

### Core Application
- Basic "Hello World" functionality
- Command-line argument handling
- Proper project structure

### Build System
- CMake configuration with modern practices
- Proper C++23 standard configuration
- Binary name configuration from .dist_build

### Dependency Management
- Conan integration for external dependencies
- fmt library integration
- Proper dependency version pinning

### Containerization
- Docker container generation
- Minimal dependency analysis
- Environment variable processing
- Proper user/group configuration
- Multiple tagging support

## What's Left to Build

### Core Application Enhancements
- [ ] Add more comprehensive examples of C++ features
- [ ] Implement error handling
- [ ] Add logging functionality
- [ ] Demonstrate fmt library usage

### Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Set up test framework
- [ ] Implement test automation

### CI/CD
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure automated builds
- [ ] Implement automated testing
- [ ] Set up container registry integration

### Documentation
- [ ] Add developer documentation
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Document API (if expanded)

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions
- **Simple Demo Application**: Started with a basic "Hello World" application to demonstrate the environment setup.
- **Modern C++ Standard**: Chose C++23 to showcase modern C++ features.
- **CMake + Conan**: Selected for build system and dependency management to follow industry best practices.
- **Containerization**: Implemented Docker containerization to demonstrate deployment practices.

### Current Direction
- **Documentation Focus**: Currently focusing on comprehensive documentation through the memory bank.
- **AI Assistant Integration**: Using Claude AI to maintain consistent documentation and knowledge transfer.
- **Maintaining Simplicity**: Keeping the application simple to focus on environment and tooling.
- **Containerization Optimization**: Emphasis on creating minimal, secure containers.

### Future Considerations
- **Feature Expansion**: Consider adding more C++ features to demonstrate language capabilities.
- **Testing Implementation**: Add proper testing to demonstrate test-driven development.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Implement CI/CD to showcase modern development workflows.
- **Additional Dependencies**: Consider adding more external libraries to demonstrate dependency management.

## Known Issues

### Build System
- No known issues

### Containerization
- No known issues

### Application
- Limited functionality (by design)
- No error handling for invalid inputs

### AI Assistant Integration
- Added inject_cline_custom_instructions.sh script for Claude AI configuration
- Configured Claude to maintain a "Memory Bank" of project documentation
- Set up structured approach to documentation with core files
- Defined workflows for Plan Mode and Act Mode
- Established documentation update processes
- Used SQLite to store configuration in VSCode's database

### VSCode Integration Enhancements
- Added password-store configuration to use basic authentication
- Added Git configuration to disable Git features in VSCode:
  - Disabled Git integration
  - Disabled Git credential store
  - Disabled automatic Git fetching
  - Disabled Git sync confirmation prompts
  - Added `"extensions.ignoreRecommendations": false` to allow extension recommendations
- Added custom prompt configuration for Distrobox container:
  - Ensures .bashrc is sourced from .bash_profile for login shells
  - Adds a custom prompt with container name in bright green
  - Sets PS1 with format "(\h) \u@\[\e[1;32m\]$CONTAINER_NAME\[\e[0m\]:\w\$"
  - Applies the new prompt immediately
- Improved launch.json processing for better debugging experience
- Enhanced project creation with automatic debug configuration
- Added auto-install extensions task that runs on folder open
- Improved tasks.json to use build.sh script for building
