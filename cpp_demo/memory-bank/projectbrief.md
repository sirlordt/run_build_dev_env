# Project Brief: C++ Demo Application

## Project Overview
This project is a C++ demo application that serves as a template for modern C++ development using containerization. It demonstrates best practices for C++ development environments, build systems, and containerization.

## Core Requirements
1. Provide a complete C++ development environment with modern tooling
2. Demonstrate proper project structure and build configuration
3. Showcase containerization of C++ applications
4. Support command-line argument handling
5. Implement proper dependency management

## Goals
1. **Development Environment**: Create a reproducible C++ development environment using Distrobox
2. **Modern C++ Support**: Utilize C++23 features and standards
3. **Build System**: Implement a modern CMake-based build system
4. **Dependency Management**: Demonstrate Conan package management
5. **Containerization**: Provide tools to package the application in a minimal Docker container
6. **IDE Integration**: Support VSCode with debugging capabilities

## Target Audience
- C++ developers looking for modern development environment setups
- Developers interested in containerizing C++ applications
- Teams seeking standardized development environments

## Success Criteria
1. Application builds successfully with modern C++ features
2. Dependencies are properly managed through Conan
3. Application can be containerized with minimal dependencies
4. Development environment can be reproduced consistently
5. Command-line arguments are properly handled

## Constraints
- Must support C++23 standard
- Must use CMake as the build system
- Must use Conan for dependency management
- Must support containerization with Docker
