# Project Brief: C++ Development Environment Setup

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive set of scripts and tools for setting up a complete C++ development environment using Distrobox with Docker support. It enables developers to quickly set up a consistent, containerized C++ development environment with all necessary tools and dependencies.

## Core Requirements

1. **Containerized Development Environment**
   - Create an isolated Ubuntu 22.04 container using Distrobox
   - Ensure Docker support within the container
   - Mount necessary host directories for seamless file access

2. **Development Tools Integration**
   - Install and configure essential C++ development tools (GCC, CMake, Conan)
   - Set up VSCode with appropriate extensions for C++ development
   - Provide Docker integration for containerizing applications

3. **Project Templates and Automation**
   - Create a demo C++ project with proper structure
   - Provide scripts for automating common development tasks
   - Enable creation of new projects from templates

4. **Containerization Support**
   - Automate Docker container creation from C++ applications
   - Handle environment variables and configuration
   - Support proper versioning and tagging

## Project Goals

1. **Simplify Environment Setup**
   - Reduce the time and complexity of setting up a C++ development environment
   - Ensure consistency across different host systems
   - Automate installation of all required dependencies

2. **Enhance Developer Experience**
   - Provide a complete, ready-to-use development environment
   - Integrate modern tools and practices for C++ development
   - Streamline the build, test, and deployment processes

3. **Enable Containerization**
   - Facilitate the packaging of C++ applications as Docker containers
   - Automate the creation of optimized Docker images
   - Support proper versioning and deployment

4. **Promote Best Practices**
   - Demonstrate proper project structure for C++ applications
   - Showcase modern C++ development techniques
   - Illustrate effective use of containerization for C++ applications

## Success Criteria

1. A single command can set up the complete development environment
2. Developers can immediately start writing, building, and testing C++ code
3. Applications can be easily containerized for deployment
4. New projects can be created from templates with minimal effort
5. The environment works consistently across different host systems
