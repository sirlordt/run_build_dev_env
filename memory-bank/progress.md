## Current Status

The project is in a functional state with all core features implemented. The main scripts (build_cpp_dev_env.sh, build.sh, build.dist.sh, helper.sh, and create_cpp_project_from_template.sh) are working as expected and provide a complete workflow for C++ development with Docker support.

Recent work has focused on:
1. Improving VSCode integration by adding password-store configuration to prevent credential prompts
2. Enhancing the create_cpp_project_from_template.sh script with better launch.json processing
3. Adding nano to the list of installed packages for better text editing options
4. Improving the documentation to reflect these changes

The memory bank documentation has been initialized to capture the project's purpose, architecture, and technical details, providing a foundation for future development and maintenance.

## Known Issues

1. **Distrobox Version Compatibility**:
   - Versions below 1.8.0 have issues with the 'distrobox rm -f' command
   - This can cause the script to hang during cleanup operations
   - Workaround: Upgrade to Distrobox 1.8.0 or higher

2. **Docker Socket Permissions**:
   - Setting the Docker socket permissions to 666 has security implications
   - This approach is chosen for simplicity but may not be suitable for all environments
   - Potential improvement: Implement more granular permission handling

3. **VSCode Integration**:
   - Some VSCode extensions may have specific requirements that are not automatically handled
   - Users may need to manually configure certain extensions
   - Potential improvement: Add more comprehensive extension configuration

4. **Template Limitations**:
   - The current template system is basic and may not handle complex project structures well
   - Template customization options are limited
   - Potential improvement: Implement a more flexible template system

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Some error conditions may not be properly handled or reported
   - Users may need to manually recover from certain failures
   - Potential improvement: Enhance error detection and recovery mechanisms

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach (Pre-2025-04-19)

- Basic Distrobox container setup
- Manual installation of development tools
- Limited Docker integration
- No project templates
- Minimal logging and error handling

### First Major Update (2025-04-19 09:25:00)

- Added Docker support for the C++ development environment
- Improved log file management
- Enhanced environment variable handling
- Added Docker-related VSCode extensions
- Fixed container home directory cleanup safety checks

### Second Major Update (2025-04-19 13:03:00)

- Fixed issues in the debug.sh script
- Improved Docker tag format handling
- Added validation for empty tags
- Enhanced variable substitution for timestamps

### Third Major Update (2025-04-19 19:20:00)

- Added new scripts for improved C++ development workflow:
  - build.sh for automating the C++ application build process
  - build.dist.sh for building Docker containers
  - create_cpp_project_from_template.sh for creating new projects
  - helper.sh for utility functions
- Enhanced Distrobox container management
- Improved error handling and validation

### Latest Update (2025-04-19 20:02:00)

- Enhanced create_cpp_project_from_template.sh with improved logging
- Updated documentation to clarify script usage
- Fixed logging issues in create_cpp_project_from_template.sh
- Ensured consistent formatting across all operation types

### Staged Changes (Not Yet Committed)

- Added nano to the list of installed packages for better text editing options
- Added VSCode password-store configuration to use basic authentication
- Added VSCode Git configuration to disable Git features in the container:
  - Disabled Git integration in VSCode
  - Disabled Git credential store
  - Disabled automatic Git fetching
  - Disabled Git sync confirmation prompts
- Added custom prompt configuration for Distrobox container:
  - Ensures .bashrc is sourced from .bash_profile for login shells
  - Adds a custom prompt with container ID in bright green
  - Sets PS1 with format "(\h) \u@\[\e[1;32m\]$CONTAINER_ID\[\e[0m\]:\w\$"
  - Applies the new prompt immediately
- Enhanced launch.json processing in create_cpp_project_from_template.sh:
  - Added proper commenting and uncommenting of program lines
